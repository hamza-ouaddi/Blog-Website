# Blog-Website
a Blog Website project. After learning some new features with back-end using Node.js (Express.js), as well as EJS to generate more pages easily. In this blog website, you cane create a post with a title and description, then post it on the website. Every time you create a post, the website redirect you to the home page. Moreover, in order to read the whole post, you can click on the post title or read more button, so that you will be redirected to the post page.

I used as well Sass with CSS, it is was more flexible and made CSS more powerful and organized. 

I am still gonna develop this project more in the future.
